            <p>Hi, I'm Victoria, I'm 20 and from Costa Rica. I am the oldest sister of 3 daughters. About 8 months ago, I moved on from my 
                family house in Limón to San José, the capital of the country, where I started my first job as a bilingual customer service representative.
                I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, some of my hobbies are reading sometimes I attend a book club where we discuss the 
                reading of the month, and is one of my favorite activities. I also enjoy watching series and doing new activities, I recently started 
                attending zumba classes and it's too much fun!

                Costa Rica is a small Central American country with great biodiversity and beautiful landscapes. Bordered by the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, Costa Rica boasts beautiful beaches, tropical rainforests and diverse ecosystems.
                Its capital, San José, offers a cultural center with museums, theaters and lively markets.
